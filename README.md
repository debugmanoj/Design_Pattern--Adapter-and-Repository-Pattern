Repository Pattern
The Repository Pattern acts as an abstraction layer between the application and the database. It helps organize database queries in a separate class, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. Instead of writing database logic in multiple places, the repository handles all data operations.

Example:
In a MERN app, instead of using Model.find() directly in your services, you create a UserRepository class that manages all database queries related to users.

Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern is used to make two incompatible systems work together by acting as a bridge between them. It converts one interface into another that the application expects.

Example:
If your MERN app fetches data from two different APIs with different response formats, an Adapter can standardize them into a single format so your app can handle them easily.
